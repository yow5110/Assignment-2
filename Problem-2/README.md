# Week 2 Assignment 2


TASK: Here you will write a variation of the script we worked on in class that converts energy in eV to wavelength in nm and detect photons that are red. Instead of finding  red photons, modify your code so that it determines if the photon wavelength is within the visible spectrum. (What is this range?) You will need to do sweep of photon energies between 1.0 and 3.0 eV. Careful when choosing the upper bound inside arange().

EXPECTED OUTCOME: 

A photon with energy 1.0 eV has a wavelength of 1243.1 nm

A photon with energy 1.2 eV has a wavelength of 1035.9 nm

A photon with energy 1.4 eV has a wavelength of 887.9 nm

A photon with energy 1.6 eV has a wavelength of 777.0 nm

A photon with energy 1.8 eV has a wavelength of 690.6 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 2.0 eV has a wavelength of 621.6 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 2.2 eV has a wavelength of 565.1 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 2.4 eV has a wavelength of 518.0 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 2.6 eV has a wavelength of 478.1 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 2.8 eV has a wavelength of 444.0 nm

   this is visible
   
A photon with energy 3.0 eV has a wavelength of 414.4 nm
