# Week 2 Assignment 3

This assignment lets you practice with conditional blocks (i.e. if statements). One of the common uses of conditional blocks is to check if input values from users are valid. For example, if we run a calculation involving a log function, we need to be prepared that users may feed an invalid argument to that log function and warn them if that happens.

TASK: Write a program that, given an input number, it computes its natural logarithm using the numpy log() function. The program should print a clear message if the input number is not an allowed value of the log() function. 

EXPECTED OUTCOME: When called with an input of 2.718 (an approximation of e), the code should return a value close to 1. When called with a value smaller or equal to 0, the code should return a message "The value you entered is not a valid input for the log() function, choose a number greater than 0".
